# Hello World
I am Md. Mushfiqur Rahman (also known as mdvirus). I am a programmer, developer, writer and speaker. I learned basic programming in 2016. Though I was a high-school student then, I only focused on competitive programming. I have competed in 7+ national level programming contests with a result of being at top 12 in the ranklist. I also regularly attend online programming contests in popular online judges. Recently I started my developing journey. Because I think, now I can use my competitive programming skills into this.

Mainly I do competitive programming and I am pretty good at it. Beside that, I develop Web applications, Windows applications, Android applications and Websites. I teach competitive programming too. I have also set many programming problems in Programming Contests. Currently I am studying. So I am ready to take part in developing projects as a part timer.
